## 🚀 Projects  

 
### [**Credyte – Credit Risk Scoring & Explainability App**](https://github.com/Anou-shka/credyte) 
- Developed a production-grade Streamlit app for credit default prediction. Integrated logistic regression and gradient boosting models, calibrated PD (probability of default), and banded risk levels. Delivered SHAP-based explainability and analyst-style outputs for transparent decision support.  
- Engineered an automated feature pipeline: repayment trend slopes, utilization ratios, average paydowns, delinquency history, and bill growth dynamics. Implemented scalable data handling, log-transformations for skewed variables, and model persistence with joblib.  
- Crafted a modular and recruiter-facing UX. Clean “Prediction & Explainability” tab, side-by-side SHAP force/ waterfall plots, and number-inputs for repayment + prior status. One-command deploy, lightweight dependencies, and a future-ready structure for model retraining and API integration.  


### [**Portfolio Pulse - Portfolio Return and Risk Dashboard**](https://portfolio-pulse.onrender.com) 
- Built a production-ready portfolio analytics app in Streamlit with intraday 1-min and nightly EOD updates. Implemented Sharpe, Beta, Tracking Error, Information Ratio, max drawdown, efficient frontier, and Monte Carlo VaR/ES. Added beginner-friendly tooltips and CSV downloads.
- Engineered an automated and reliable data pipeline: yfinance ingestion to Parquet on a persistent Render disk, New York trading-day logic, a background intraday daemon, and a scheduled EOD updater. Secured access with a simple code for link-only usage.
- Designed a thoughtful UX and modular codebase. Plotly charts with right-side labels, interactive rolling risk, sector and region diversification, and quick “what-if” scenarios for weights, benchmarks, and time windows. Modular Python packages (metrics_core, metrics_active) and a one-command deploy.

### [**Digital Twins for Infection Risk Modelling in Elevators**](https://github.com/Anou-shka/Digital-Twins) 
- Developed a real-time Digital Twin system using Python, IoT sensors, and ML models (K-Means, Decision Trees) to classify airborne infection risk zones in elevator cabins.
- Achieved >90% F1-score in zone classification using environmental data (CO₂, temperature, humidity), enabling actionable ventilation recommendations.
- Integrated Wells-Riley and statistical models for disease-specific risk estimation (COVID-19, measles, TB), demonstrating potential for scalable public health transformation in built environments.

### [**Natural Language Processing Sentiment Analysis**](https://github.com/Anou-shka/SC4002_NLP)  
- Designed and trained RNN-based models, achieving a 66.89% validation accuracy, and improved performance using BiGRU architecture to reach 74.86%.  
- Implemented a DeBERTaV3 transformer model, fine-tuned on a custom dataset, achieving a test accuracy of 90.24%, significantly outperforming prior models.

### [**Analysis of Co-occurrence Patterns of Points of Interest (POI)**](https://github.com/Anou-shka/SC4020_Project_2)  
- Utilized the Apriori algorithm to uncover frequent itemsets and association rules, such as a 3.49 lift correlation between Hair Salons and Laundry services in City B.  
- Built a next-location recommendation system using LSTM models, achieving accurate predictions for user movement patterns. 

### [**Clustering Algorithms: Comparative Analysis**](https://github.com/lliangmengg/SC4020-Data-Analytics-Mining-Project)  
- Evaluated clustering algorithms (K-means, DBSCAN, GMM, Agglomerative Clustering) across four dataset patterns, achieving an Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) of 1.0 for DBSCAN and GMM.  
- Demonstrated DBSCAN's robustness in handling noise (ARI: 0.99) and GMM's adaptability to varying densities (Silhouette Score: 0.72).  

### [**Query Execution Plan (QEP) Optimization and Visualization**](https://github.com/FaizRsl/Database_System_Principles_Project_2) 
- Developed a dynamic QEP generator using PostgreSQL and React, reducing query costs by up to 93% on a 6M+ row TPC-H dataset.  
- Created an interactive GUI for QEP visualization, enabling non-technical stakeholders to analyze and optimize query performance.  

### [**Database Management System Design and Optimization**](https://github.com/FaizRsl/Database_System_Principles_Project_1) 
- Built a custom database system with a 100MB storage capacity, using B+ tree indexing for efficient data retrieval across 10,000+ records.  
- Improved query performance by 25% through memory optimization and incremental indexing techniques.  

### [**Gaystro: Restaurant Search and Reservation System**](https://github.com/Anou-shka/SC2006-Software-Eng)
- Engineered a web-based application with MongoDB, React, and Node.js, handling over 1,000 concurrent users with a response time of under 5 seconds.
