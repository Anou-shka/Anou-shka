## ðŸš€ Projects  

### [**Natural Language Processing Sentiment Analysis**](https://github.com/Anou-shka/SC4002_NLP)  
- Designed and trained RNN-based models, achieving a 66.89% validation accuracy, and improved performance using BiGRU architecture to reach 74.86%.  
- Implemented a DeBERTaV3 transformer model, fine-tuned on a custom dataset, achieving a test accuracy of 90.24%, significantly outperforming prior models.  

### [**Query Execution Plan (QEP) Optimization and Visualization**](https://github.com/FaizRsl/Database_System_Principles_Project_2) 
- Developed a dynamic QEP generator using PostgreSQL and React, reducing query costs by up to 93% on a 6M+ row TPC-H dataset.  
- Created an interactive GUI for QEP visualization, enabling non-technical stakeholders to analyze and optimize query performance.  

### [**Database Management System Design and Optimization**](https://github.com/FaizRsl/Database_System_Principles_Project_1) 
- Built a custom database system with a 100MB storage capacity, using B+ tree indexing for efficient data retrieval across 10,000+ records.  
- Improved query performance by 25% through memory optimization and incremental indexing techniques.  

### [**Gaystro: Restaurant Search and Reservation System**](https://github.com/Anou-shka/SC2006-Software-Eng)
- Engineered a web-based application with MongoDB, React, and Node.js, handling over 1,000 concurrent users with a response time under 5 seconds.  
- Integrated real-time reservation management, increasing user engagement by 30% through a seamless UI and dynamic booking features.  

### [**Clustering Algorithms: Comparative Analysis**](https://github.com/lliangmengg/SC4020-Data-Analytics-Mining-Project)  
- Evaluated clustering algorithms (K-means, DBSCAN, GMM, Agglomerative Clustering) across four dataset patterns, achieving an Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) of 1.0 for DBSCAN and GMM.  
- Demonstrated DBSCAN's robustness in handling noise (ARI: 0.99) and GMM's adaptability to varying densities (Silhouette Score: 0.72).  

### [**Analysis of Co-occurrence Patterns of Points of Interest (POI)**](https://github.com/Anou-shka/SC4020_Project_2)  
- Utilized the Apriori algorithm to uncover frequent itemsets and association rules, such as a 3.49 lift correlation between Hair Salons and Laundry services in City B.  
- Built a next-location recommendation system using LSTM models, achieving accurate predictions for user movement patterns.  

### [**Final Year Project Management System (FYPMS)**](https://github.com/its-naptime/SC2002-FYPManager)  
- Designed a console-based application for managing final-year projects, supporting 200+ users and improving processing efficiency by 40%.  
- Integrated object-oriented principles and the Entity-Controller-Boundary design pattern for modular and maintainable code.
